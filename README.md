## Implementation of ARM Single Cycle Processor Control Unit


### Introduction:
This is an implementation of the control unit for an ARM single-cycle processor using SystemVerilog. The control unit is responsible for coordinating the flow of data through the processor and ensuring that instructions are executed correctly.

### Design:
The control unit is designed to retrieve instructions from memory, decode them, and control the appropriate functional units to execute the instruction. The design includes modules for instruction decoding, register file control, and ALU control.

### Implementation:
The control unit is implemented using SystemVerilog, a hardware description language that allows for the specification of digital circuits.
<!-- ### Usage:
To use the control unit, the design files can be compiled using a SystemVerilog compiler, such as Synopsys VCS or Cadence Incisive. The resulting netlist can be used to program an FPGA or ASIC for hardware testing. The testbenches can be run to verify the correctness of the design.-->
